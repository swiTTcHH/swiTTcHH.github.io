          I am a Resourceful professional successful in developing innovative
          web designs and features with solid knowledge frontend web development
          with ability to quickly learn new technologies. I am a hardworking,
          passionate and goal driven frontend developer. During my time as a
          student of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, I quickly came to
          realize that the course I was studying, Microbiology, has no market in
          Nigeria and decided to invest in my passion instead. I have been in
          tech for quite some time and I have come to realize that it is not an easy road. It is a road of constant learning and self improvement.
